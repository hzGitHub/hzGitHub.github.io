      <description>Currents traveling within the human body between the electrodes do not travel as in a wire; instead, as the whole body is a conductor, the currents try to spread as much as possible with the constraints that it has to start and end at the electrodes. This simulator shows the path of the current when using an active electrode and a dispersive electrode. The Path of the current is shown as the active electrode is moved within the body and reacts accordingly when a new dispersive electrode is selected from the multiple options presented.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms for Multi-physics multi-scale modeling</title>

      <description>Developing an interactive simulation environment for electrosurgery that includes coupled electro-thermo-mechanical multiphysics modeling, continuum level, micromechanical level multilevel modeling and topological change can be challenging. Current best practices for the efficient solution of such problem are based almost exclusively on multigrid methods and preconditioned Krylov subspace methods. Design of efficient application specific monolithic multiphysics multigrid solvers or preconditioners is challenging. Therefore, our aim in this project is to develop efficient finite element solver and block preconditioning technique that can effectively deflate the spectrum of the system matrix leading to exponential convergence of the Arnoldi iterations for the multiphysics, multilevel modeling of electrosurgery without compromising physical fidelity and stability.</description>

      <description>This simulator presents a virtual operating room fire scenario and comprises two sections. In the first one, the user is guided in identifying the elements of the operating room that for part of the fire triangle (heat, fuel and oxidizing agent). The second part the user is guided by the simulation to contain a fire, following the established procedures for this emergency situation.   </description>

      <description>This simulator presents the differences between cutting and coagulating waveforms provided by the electrosurgical generator at different power levels. The simulator enables the user to see the effects on the tissue in real time as they follow the directions that highlight proper techniques and undesired effects.   </description>
